# What is Notification?
A notification is a message that Android displays outside your app's UI to provide the user with reminders, communication from other people, or other timely information from your app. Users can tap the notification to open your app or take an action directly from the notification.


Implementation of Notification is simple. We can show notification to give more information to user related to the application. We can show normal notification with some information, downloading details, progress of some process taking place in application and so on. 

# Progress Bar Notification 

To implement progress bar notification we need to initiaize the notification, set the maximum progress we will be showing and once its completed update the notification to inform the user of completion of progress. 



# Regular Notification

To implement notification we need to initiaize the notification channel, then set the Activity it will open when click on the notification and how it will look.
